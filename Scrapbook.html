              <h3>Project Statment</h3>
              <p>
                Throughout my whole life, I have enjoyed reading, telling
                stories, and entering the lives and worlds of fiction and
                fantasy. However, throughout my time in college, I stopped
                reading books and started hanging out with friends, playing
                video games, and going to the movies instead. I feel as though
                it had a negative impact on my creativity and imagination as
                reading gave me an outlet that nothing else could.
                <br /><br />
                In recent years stories have become more important to me as I’ve
                immersed myself a lot more in tv shows and books. However, with
                the internet, social media, and stigmatization surrounding
                reading, I have felt subconsciously pressured to keep my passion
                to myself and haven’t been able to share it with the outside
                world.
                <br /><br />
                Midway through 2021, I discovered the online book "Omniscient
                Readers Viewpoint" which had forever change my life and
                rekindled my childhood passion. This book taught me more about
                who I am than any other story I've read before. To me, it was
                more of an experience than a book. I hope everyone can find a
                story that can ignite their own spark the way that Omniscient
                Reader did for me. Now that I've felt that emotion and feeling,
                I'm constantly searching for the next story that will give me
                that same spark as before.
                <br /><br />
                I am looking to provide people with similar interests as mine a
                place to share their ideas, experiences, and feelings about
                stories in a way that is similar to a personal journal.
                Additionally, the added capability of allowing the user to share
                their entries with others both inside and outside of their
                groups can connect through nostalgia from revisiting their own
                or others' past experiences.
                <br /><br />
                Following the design thinking methodology, along with a variety
                of secondary research, and conducting target audience-based
                surveys, I was able to get many responses with an inclination
                towards nostalgia and wanting to reflect on their past;
                <br /><br />
                "I can remember myself re-enacting something from a story or
                having a similar connection to it"
                <br /><br />
                "When I was younger I would delve into books to make me feel
                something."
                <br /><br /><br /><br />

                As a concept, Scrapbook is an online interactive journal that
                allows users to record and document their feelings regarding
                books they have read. The purpose of this is to later relive
                their nostalgia and share their experiences within and outside
                the reading community.
                <br /><br />
                This offers users the chance to think back on their past and
                experience the same emotions they once felt. This also gives
                them an opportunity to interact with their communities and
                benefit from this shared interest by sending each other new book
                recommendations, seeing what their friends are interested in,
                keeping updated with the current book talk, or having a way to
                express themselves within their book club.
