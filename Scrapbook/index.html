                  Little Rabbit Foo Foo
                </p>
                <p>
                  <br />
                  The earliest memory I can recall is the day of my 5th
                  birthday, my last day at kindergarten in fact. <br /><br />
                  I remember on our birthdays in kindergarten, we got to choose
                  which book the teacher would read to us, which was the
                  highlight of my day. Our teacher read books to us frequently,
                  but today was special because I got to pick. I chose my
                  favourite one of all, "Little Rabbit Foo Foo," in which a
                  mischievous rabbit hops around the forest, bopping the little
                  field mice on the head. I loved this story as a child, I found
                  it hilarious to watch Rabbit Foo Foo act ridiculously and then
                  get scolded afterwards.
                  <br /><br />
                  I distinctly remember that day, the teacher gathered the
                  children and I on the mat that day and asked me, "Jacob,
                  because it's your birthday today, would you like to pick the
                  story?" Naturally, I said yes and decided on Rabbit Foo Foo.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="page back"></div>
          </div>

              <div id="container">
                <p>
                  <br />
                  I can still picture how happy I was to choose my own story to
                  be told, and how fixated I was on that book, eyes wide open
                  when the teacher read it out to the class.
                  <br /><br />
                  I distinctly remember that day, the teacher gathered the
                  children and I on the mat that day and asked me, "Jacob,
                  because it's your birthday today, would you like to pick the
                  story?" Naturally, I said yes and decided on Rabbit Foo Foo. I
                  can still picture how happy I was to choose my own story to be
                  told, and how fixated I was on that book, eyes wide open when
                  the teacher read it out to the class.
                  <br /><br />
                  Once she finished reading I really wanted the teacher to read
                  it again, as it was my last day at kindergarten and I wouldn't
                  have the same opportunity to read that same book again. I
                  longed for that thrill of being told a story.
                  <br /><br />
                  Can you just imagine what it's like, immersing yourself in
                  something you love so much for that very last time?

                  That's what it was like for me, but luckily I was able to grow
                  up and continue reading, writing, and creating more stories,
                  not only for me but for others to enjoy. <br /><br />

                  My favorite year during primary school was during year 6 when
                  I was 10-11. This was the time I really found my passion for
                  stories and storytelling, as our teacher would spend time each
                  week reading books to the class such as The Hobbit.
                  <br /><br />
                  Again much like when I was much younger, we would sit down in
                  class a few times a week while our teacher would read such
                  books to us. We would sit in silence and I often close my eyes
                  to imagine the scenarios happening in the book, playing out in
                  my mind so vividly that it felt real.
                  <br /><br />
                  With this spark of creativity, I would spend time each day
                  writing my own stories and illustrating my own stick-figure
                  comic books where I could let my imagination go wild. I am so
                  grateful to have been brought up this way, being able to have
                  a fictional outlet, constantly at my fingertips as I can't
                  even imagine another life where I wasn't an avid reader.

                <p>
                  <br />
                  All my life, I have enjoyed reading, telling stories, and
                  entering the lives and worlds of fiction. However, I stopped
                  reading books throughout my time in college and started
                  hanging out with friends, playing video games, and going to
                  the movies instead. I feel as though it had a negative impact
                  on my creativity and imagination as reading gave me that
                  outlet that nothing else could.
                  <br /><br />
                  Reading the novel Omniscient Readers Viewpoint, sent me right
                  back to my childhood and made me realize how much I still love
                  to read and use my imagination. I started reading the book
                  simply out of love for the recent comic adaptation.
                  <br /><br />
                  I read it in my free time while riding the train, going to
                  school, or just relaxing at home in the sun. As I read it
                  more, I found myself really appreciating and connecting to the
                  story with the many characters that were explored in its
                  fictional world.

                  I became attached to the main character, Dokja Kim, since he
                  was built on the concept of a reader, someone who lived their
                  life with their head in a book much like my own life.
                  <br /><br />
                  I felt a sense of identification with him and a want to learn
                  more about his experience by getting to know him better. I
                  found this story to be more of an experience than a book, one
                  that taught me more about who I am than any other story I've
                  read in the past.
                  <br /><br />
                  Now that I've experienced that emotion and feeling, I'm always
                  looking for the next story that will give me that same spark
                  as before, and I hope everyone can find a story that can
                  ignite their own spark the way that Omniscient Reader did for
                  me.
