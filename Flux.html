              <h3>Project Summary</h3>
              <p>For our new enterprise project, we were tasked to create a solution to a problem we or others were facing in their lives. Japanese Animators are well underpayed earning sometimes up to 14 thousand USD a year compared to animators in USA earning around 60 thousand a year.
                <br><br>What I wanted to create was a way for animators to get extra support and income by uploading designs and keyframes they've worked on to a website for fans of their work to buy.
              </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Project Question</h3>
                <p>What are the codes and conventions of anime and how can they be used within Generative Art?</p>

                <h3>Initial Ideation</h3>
                <p>For the initial research and ideation I worked on fleshing out the idea and giving it depth with how it would work, the brand values, tone of voice and why this would fill a gap in the market.<br><br>This followed with basic logo designs and a general style to encapsulate the brand with warm and playful colours and inviting, simple font choices.</p>

                <h3>Lofi Prototyping</h3>
                <p>After developing my reasearch and initial ideas/designs I developed a low fidelity prototype of the web app in Figma, focusing on the interativity for the user and the layout style.
                  <br><br>
                  Through user testing I found many flaws with my current developments where some pages of the web app weren't distinct enough, the search function was a little confusing to use and some of the interactive elements could be changed to help with hirachey.</p>

            <div class="development">
                <h3>High Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
                <p>From the previous feedback I developed a hifi prototype with included text information, graphics and imagery that would be utilised on the web app.
                  <br><br>
                  Some further testing was done as hidden flaws were found sunch as some graphic could be changed to make more sense and some other pages should be added to give users more accessability.</p>

                <h3>Final Artefact - Web App</h3>
                <p>The final output of this project resulted in a fuctional web app and service that provides a place for freelance animators and anime artists to upload and display their work for fans across the globe to view and even purchase.</p>
